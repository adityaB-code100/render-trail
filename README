This project presents ResQConnect, a web-based emergency assistance platform aimed at providing timely and critical support during disasters and emergencies. Inspired by modern disaster alert systems and AI-based virtual assistants, ResQConnect combines multiple emergency services into a single, accessible interface. The platform enables users to receive real-time disaster alerts, access first aid information, register emergency complaints, and interact with an AI-powered chatbot for immediate guidance.

Developed using a Flask backend and MongoDB database, the system integrates Gemini AI APIs to enhance the chatbot's responsiveness and relevance. It is designed to assist users during a wide range of emergencies, including natural disasters, medical crises, and roadside incidents. By leveraging artificial intelligence and a user-centric design, ResQConnect ensures rapid response, accurate information delivery, and increased user engagement during critical situations.
